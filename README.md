## **Home Page Introduction**

### **Course Introduction**

The **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course focuses on mastering the art of developing efficient algorithms while analyzing their complexities. It provides a deep dive into foundational concepts such as **iterations, backtracking, recursion**, and explores advanced data structures and algorithms.

### **What We've Learned**
Our learning journey has been divided into:
- **Foundations**: Understanding recursion and iterative solutions.
- **Trees**: Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and more.
- **Graphs**: Algorithms like Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Kruskal's for real-world applications.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, and pattern-matching algorithms.

### **Real-Life Applications**
These concepts are directly applicable to problems like:
- Navigation systems (shortest path algorithms).
- Text search engines (pattern matching).
- Data organization in databases (efficient tree structures).

## **Project Introduction: Aarohan – A Smart City**

### **Overview**
Welcome to **Aarohan**, an innovative smart city development project spanning **1,500 square kilometers** amidst breathtaking hills and mountains. With a budget of **₹15,000 crores**, this futuristic city is designed to be a sustainable, eco-friendly urban marvel accommodating **1 million residents**.

### **Problem Space and Insights**
This project stems from the need for a harmonious blend of **nature, technology, and sustainability**. By analyzing white papers and global trends in urban development, we identified key challenges such as:
- Overcrowded cities.
- Inefficient waste management.
- Lack of smart technology in everyday infrastructure.

Our findings emphasized the need for **sustainable city designs** powered by **renewable energy, smart public services, and eco-tourism**.
