## **Project Introduction: Aarohan – A Smart City**

### **Overview**
Our team is leading the charge on developing a 1,500-square-kilometer smart city named Aarohan, surrounded by hills and mountains. With a projected population of 1 million and a ₹15,000 crore budget, the project combines advanced technology, sustainable practices, and innovative urban design to create a modern, eco-friendly community. The initiative showcases your team’s dedication to crafting a forward-thinking urban environment that integrates nature, technology, and efficient infrastructure.


### **Problem Space and Insights**
This project stems from the need for a harmonious blend of **nature, technology, and sustainability**. By analyzing white papers and global trends in urban development, we identified key challenges such as:
- Overcrowded cities.
- Inefficient waste management.
- Lack of smart technology in everyday infrastructure.

Our findings emphasized the need for **sustainable city designs** powered by **renewable energy, smart public services, and eco-tourism**.
