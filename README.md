        <h2>Course Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course focuses on mastering the art of developing efficient solutions for computational problems. 
            It equips us with the knowledge to design, implement, and optimize algorithms while analyzing their space and time complexity. 
            We’ve explored foundational techniques such as recursion, iteration, and backtracking, all of which are vital for tackling complex problems systematically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our journey through this course has covered a diverse range of topics. Foundational algorithms like BFS and DFS laid the groundwork, while 
            tree-based data structures such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees strengthened our understanding of hierarchical 
            organization. Advanced concepts like sorting algorithms and pattern-matching techniques, alongside graph algorithms like Dijkstra's 
            and Kruskal’s, enabled us to address real-world challenges with precision.
        </p>
        <p>
            Connecting this knowledge to real-time applications, we see how these concepts power systems we rely on daily. From navigating routes 
            using graph algorithms to optimizing database search with trees and efficiently processing text with pattern-matching algorithms, the 
            course bridges theoretical knowledge with practical utility.

        <h2>Course Project Introduction</h2>
        
        <h3>Problem Space and Its Origins</h3>
        <p>
            The project <i>Aarohan: A Smart City Development Project</i> addresses the growing need for sustainable, technology-driven urban development. 
            Our problem space emerged from analyzing rapid urbanization challenges—resource management, environmental impact, and the demand for infrastructure efficiency. 
            A comprehensive review of white papers on smart city design revealed key areas requiring innovation: energy, transportation, waste management, and public services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our design focuses on harmonizing advanced technology with sustainability principles, creating a city that integrates nature and modernity seamlessly. 
            Business cases were identified by considering the unique needs of residents, environmental goals, and technological advancements to achieve a scalable, eco-friendly urban model.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Problem Definition and Team Details</h3>
        <p>
            The project aims to develop a 1,500 sq. km smart city for 1 million residents, supported by a budget of ₹15,000 crores. Aarohan will leverage cutting-edge 
            digital infrastructure, sustainable energy practices, and innovative solutions to address urban challenges while enhancing the quality of life.
