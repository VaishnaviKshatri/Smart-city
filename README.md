### **Course Introduction**

The "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" course dives into the basics of creating and improving algorithms to tackle real-world problems. It focuses on how to evaluate their performance, looking at time and space complexity to ensure they run efficiently. We will pick up practical skills for designing and refining algorithms, making it easier to solve tricky computational challenges.

### **What We've Learned**
-Our learning journey has been divided into:

-Trees and Applications:
Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, 2-3 Trees, and Red-Black Trees for organizing data.

-Array Query Algorithms:
Fenwick Tree, Sparse Table, and Look-up Table for efficient range queries and data processing.

-Sorting and Searching:
Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Binary Search to organize and find data quickly.

-Graph Algorithms:
BFS and DFS for exploring networks, Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford for shortest paths, and Prim’s and Kruskal’s for connecting nodes efficiently.


### **Real-Life Applications**
These concepts are directly applicable to problems like:
- Navigation systems (shortest path algorithms).
- Text search engines (pattern matching).
- Data organization in databases (efficient tree structures).
