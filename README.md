### **Course Introduction**

The "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" course dives into the basics of creating and improving algorithms to tackle real-world problems. It focuses on how to evaluate their performance, looking at time and space complexity to ensure they run efficiently. We will pick up practical skills for designing and refining algorithms, making it easier to solve tricky computational challenges.

### **Learnings**
-Trees and Applications:
Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, 2-3 Trees, and Red-Black Trees for organizing data.

-Array Query Algorithms:
Fenwick Tree, Sparse Table, and Look-up Table for efficient range queries and data processing.

-Sorting and Searching:
Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Binary Search to organize and find data quickly.

-Graph Algorithms:
BFS and DFS for exploring networks, Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford for shortest paths, and Prim’s and Kruskal’s for connecting nodes efficiently.


### **Real-Life Applications**
- Using BFS and DFS for network traversal and shortest path calculations.  
- Implementing Binary Search Trees and Tries for efficient data retrieval.  
- Applying Dijkstra’s and Prim’s algorithms for route optimization in transportation.  
- Utilizing pattern-matching algorithms in text processing and DNA sequencing.

## **Project Introduction: Aarohan – A Smart City**

### **Overview**
Our team is leading the charge on developing a 1,500-square-kilometer smart city named Aarohan, surrounded by hills and mountains. With a projected population of 1 million and a ₹15,000 crore budget, the project combines advanced technology, sustainable practices, and innovative urban design to create a modern, eco-friendly community. The initiative showcases your team’s dedication to crafting a forward-thinking urban environment that integrates nature, technology, and efficient infrastructure.


### **Problem Space and Insights**
This project stems from the need for a harmonious blend of **nature, technology, and sustainability**. By analyzing white papers and global trends in urban development, we identified key challenges such as:
- Overcrowded cities.
- Inefficient waste management.
- Lack of smart technology in everyday infrastructure.

Our findings emphasized the need for **sustainable city designs** powered by **renewable energy, smart public services, and eco-tourism**.
